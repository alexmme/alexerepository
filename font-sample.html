    <p class= "lede">The Magical Crawsfish"</p>
    <p class= "copy">
    There once was a girl named Alice who lived in a swamp. In the daytime she helped her father
    catch crawfish off Lake Pontchatrain. In the evening they would come back home and 
    prepare the seafood boil. Alice would season the broth and her mother would peel the potatoes. 
    Her father would lift up the bucket of crawfish high over his head and dump them all in one fell
    swoop. Right before they hit the boiling water, Alice saw one of the little critters look up at her
    and give her a wink.
    </p>
    <p class= "subtext"> From that day on, Alice never ate another crawfish.
